# Easy-Energy
In the actual landscape of energy consumption, among the many kinds of consumers of the brazilian electrical system,
is observed a unrestrained increased consumption and waste, inherent to the bad design of the electric grid, and a 
lack of culture focused on economy energy.In this perspective the Easy Energy,software developed with Python programming language,
aimed at energy eﬃciency and energy saving, mapping and diagnosing through a graphical interface, all kinds of electrical charges
present in a home or industry, and calculating a prediction of the energy tariﬀ and economic saving plans.It is presented as an
eﬀective energy taxes preview tool, regardless of a speciﬁc and technical knowledge of electrical systems.Planning to set up a 
prototype aimed at the energy eﬃciency market, as eﬀective as the existing ones, promoting a diagnosis of energy tariﬀ, which may
be framed in various fare classes instituted by ANEEL.Through an interactive and intuitive graphical interface, the user will point
all equipment and electronic appliances present in his property.In this way the software will provide a current energy tariﬀ forecast,
presenting itself as a very eﬀective tool to control and forecast spending in the household and industry, using updated parameters in
real time.
